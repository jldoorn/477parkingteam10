            <h2>Project Name: Parking Tracking System</h2>
			
            <h2>Project Description:</h2> The Parking Tracking System project includes tracking the parking availability of 
			a single entrance/single exit garage for the purpose of a more efficient parking experience. This project will
			utilize ultrasonic sensors that will communicate with the microcontroller to determine whether a car is entering
			or leaving the garage. The system will also use 7-segment displays that are driven from a microcontroller to show 
			users of the garage the total number of spaces that are avaialble. Along with this, the system will also have a
			keypad and OLED screen that will communicate with the microcontroller on the main module to allow the user to 
			initially configure and set-up the system, as well as allowing for changes to be made after the system is initialized, 
			such as adding and removing Car Detector Modules. The keypad will function by the microcontroller using a row column 
			matrix to determine which button is pressed. Wireless communication will be done using a WiFi 
			module on the Aggregator Module, as well as the Car Detector Modules, with which the microcontroller will interface
			in order to send and receive data packets. A laptop charger, with DC output 12V 5A, will be used to power the Aggregator Module with a 
			switching regulator chip and a linear regulator chip to step down the input voltage. A portable battery bank, with DC output 5V 2A, will be used to	
			power the Car Detector Module with a linear regulator chip to step down the input voltage.
			<br>
			<br>
			Bonus Design Goals:
			<ol>
				<li>(Hardware) One bonus design goal for our project will be to design our own 12V to 5V DC-DC switching regulator circuit.</li>
				<li>(Hardware) Another bonus design goal will be to design our own level shifter circuit for communicating between 5V and 3.3V.</li>
				<li>(Software) A third bonus design goal will be to develop a website where the number of available spaces will be displayed and updated.</li>
			</ol>
